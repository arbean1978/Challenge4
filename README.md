04 JavaScript: Code Quiz
Purpose of this project is to create a timed JavaScript quiz, where users may save their score to their local storage after completing the coding quiz challenge by entering their initials. All the saved scores can be viewed on the highscores pageRestarting the quiz will clear the stored scores. I have not gotten the Javascript to fully work yet.

Description

The quiz is made up of 5 questions
The user has 90 seconds to complete the quiz
Everytime the user selects an answer a message tells them if the answer was correct/incorrect
If the answer was incorrect, 10 seconds is deducted from the timer
The game ends once the timer hits 0 or the user answers all the questions
The following demonstrates the application functionality: main technologies used: Arrays, Objects, For loops, Functions and callback functions, User prompts, Alerts, Intervals, Conditional statements, DOM manipulation, Local storage access, CSS Transitions, Breakpoints Event Listeners, setTimeout/ setInterval.
